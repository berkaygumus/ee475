Q1)When the q1.m file is run, it shows a image wanted at the question and 
creates a "q1.tif" file at the same folder.


Q2)There must be "peppers.png" at the same folder.
When the q2.m file is run, the results(images and histogram plots) are shown in one window, 
the values and coordinates of pixels can be learned by using tools/data tips or data cursor.
The information of the image can be shown on command window.

Q3)I used matlab for only question e. There must be "taxi36.pgm", "taxi38.pgm" and "taxi40.pgm". 
When the q3e.m file is run, it gives the subtraction of images and logical matrices with threshold 100 and 172.
When the threshold 172, there is only one point is 1. The coordinates of this point can be learned by tools/data tips or data cursor.
